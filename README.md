# Crop-Recommendation-Model-
 Crop Recommendation using Decision Tree Algorithm
• The main factors affecting the growth of the crops are temperature, humidity, rainfall, 
soil PH, and minerals. Considered the stated factors that are affecting crop production and 
made a user-friendly model for farmers to get the best products.
• Predict Crops using datasets collected from various sites, and implementing Decision 
Tree Algorithm from scratch using C++.
